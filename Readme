## 🔧 Technologies Used

## 📂 Project Structure

This project deploys a Flask application using two different versions of Docker images:

## 🚀 What I Did

1. **Initial Deployment**  
   - Deployed the application using **v1 image** via Argo CD.
   - App name in Argo CD: `demo-version`

2. **Image Update**  
   - Updated the manifest in GitHub to use `v2` image.
   - Committed & pushed the change.
   - Argo CD detected the change and updated the deployment automatically.

3. **Rollback**  
   - Used **Argo CD's rollback feature** to revert the app back to version `v1`.
